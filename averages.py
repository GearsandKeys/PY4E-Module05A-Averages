    #Write code below this line
    #WHile loop looking for done

    # print total, count(not bad data), average
    #Hmmm think about input turning into a string/int

Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the
user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count,
and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a
number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error
message and skip to the next number.

Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: bad data
Invalid input
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: done

# test case, does it take numbers and return a total, count, average and not break with something weird
