# PY4E-Module05A-Averages
Exercise for iterations from PY4E

# Assignment
Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the
user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count,
and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a
number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error
message and skip to the next number.

## Starter Code
```python
print("Enter a number: ")
```

## Expected Output
```
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: bad data
Invalid input
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: done
16 3 5.333333333333333
```

## Expected Output Format
```
print(<total>, <count>, <average>)
```

## Test
Once your code is finished, run `pytest` in the terminal to test it!
